{"review": "First timer going out a new place for burgers. \u00a0We started out with potato skins which came out with 4 half slices, \u00a0one more burnt than others but other than that a good portion of fillings in each, with bacon, red onions and cheese. The cheese part was bland and could have used a sharp cheddar instead. I ordered the onion burger which came with cheddar and onion rings and a side of fries. The burger was cooked perfectly at medium with a nice char. The burger is huge! Took the other half home. My hubby had the Patty melt which was not a traditional melt. \u00a0It had whole grain toast and it was not grilled. The meat had great flavor though. Great fries too.The beers on tap had a combination of local to national options with many in bottle as options.

They open their large windows which feels as if you're eating outdoors (if you sit close to the window area. Their food portions are very large and generous! Servers here are very fast and kind. They definitely have great bar food here, but also great dinner food as well. I've had their roast beef sandwich and it was amazingly buttery like to me! Their traditional own burger is also great too, and the set of fries it comes with is so satisfying. I like that this place is kid friendly with the menu as well. They have a small section for the \"wee ones\", which are things kids typically like to have. Kind of funny and cute they have Shirley temple for the kid menu too. I've heard their Shepard's pie is yummy, which I plan to come back for eventually! Love Shepard's pie in general lol.

It was utterly disappointing. We ordered two dishes. One was burnt with no flavor and the other was so soggy that it fell apart once it was picked up. More detail isn't really necessary when burnt and soggy are already in the description.It was just a bad experience and nobody is perfect. Maybe next time they'll blow me away but I wouldn't hold my breath. One good thing: good selection of beers on tap along with reasonable prices but you can really get this anywhere.

{"review": "It hurts me a little to do this. As you can tell by my previous reviews, I am a huge fan of supporting small local businesses but I cannot for the life of me understand why McCloskey's is rated 4/5 stars. Perhaps it was just an off night.We went to McCloskey's for a casual meal to watch the end of the Steelers/Broncos playoff game and ate at the bar. First things first, service itself was fine. We didn't order alcoholic drinks, we just wanted to be near the TV's.Now the food.This was probably the third time I've been to McCloskey's since I moved to Ardmore two years ago. Each time, the food took more than 30 minutes (this is the kitchen, not the waiter usually, so I stand by my statement that service was fine). This was one of those things that \"redawned\" on me while we were waiting since I don't go often, it's just close and convenient. Kind of like \"oh yeah, the food usually takes awhile here\"). An idea of the timeframe: We arrived at the very beginning of the fourth quarter only to get our food with about 90 seconds left in the game. That's quite awhile when a game takes over three hours to play. All we ordered were wings and a vegetarian sandwich. And they were not busy. We found seats at the bar right away with open seats next to us as well. I also saw the cooks out of the kitchen watching a part of the game while we were waiting.I honestly felt like Gordon Ramsey on Kitchen Nightmares while eating. The wings (ordered medium) arrived burnt with all the sauce on the bottom. Thus, they were dry. There was absolutely no flavor. A rotisserie chicken from a grocery store would've had more flavor. They were burnt and dry. It was as if the sauce was put on the plate and then the wings on top of it. Even so, the sauce was not great. Maybe if the cooks were paying attention to the wings, they wouldn't of been burnt? I thought maybe this is how they were supposed to look but the people next to us also got wings and they looked properly prepared with the sauce on TOP of the wings. To be fair, I remember them being better in my past trips.The vegetarian sandwich was also a disappointment. It comes with goat cheese and basil oil. It was mostly goat cheese and basil oil with some veggies thrown in. Thus, the sandwich was soggy and had no chance of staying together while eating it. It was almost as if the goat cheese was used as a way to keep the veggies together and not fall out of the sandwich, an unsuccessful strategy. My date ate half and left the rest which is saying a lot because we hate food waste. It was nearly inedible. Overall, a bad experience. The initial goal of enjoying the game while eating wasn't even accomplished because of how long the food took. The only saving grace is that their drink list is extensive including many, many beers on tap. Many of them craft beers as well. It's also a local place. These two things got it a 2/5 instead of a 1. Unfortunately, we will probably never return.", "stars": 2, "date": "2016-01-20T00:00:00.000", "venue": "McCloskeys Tavern"}

I got the paddy melt which was excellent.The entire staff was very accommodating and the bar had some football games on. I can see why it's a popular spot in Ardmore.

It's a nice change for the client from other places here locally.2. \u00a0They do a traditional Happy Hour and Daily Dinner Specials. There are folks that come the same night at the same time every week. Top special is Prime Rib on Friday night. I mean it's big, gotta be a full 16oz.. It comes with a simple baked potato, and sauteed beans. Plain white plate.3. I prefer the bar here as the preferred spot. While Martha and I can just chat for hours.......having a beverage, watching the game or news with a well made dinner is a nice treat.4.

We both ordered the special cane sugar sodas that they offered (they contained no high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners, which I really loved because I'm pregnant) and they were delicious!

Was filled in ten minutes, with \u00a0TWO \u00a0customers, who were obviously very friendly with the hostess As for us, we will never be back.", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-09T00:00:00.000", "venue": "McCloskeys Tavern"}

{"review": "I think some on here may have an agenda other than an honest review. I have been a regular every Friday night at McCloskey's for over six months. From day one both the service and food have been great. I have taken my kids and their families and they liked it very much as well. I just about always order the prime rib special, and it is *always* prepared properly. One reviewer complained it had too much fat on it. Of course it has fat on it . . it is prime rib. I have also had their burgers, which are right up there with the best around . . no kidding, they really are !!I have never had a bad meal at McCloskey's. Does it get crowded? Yes. \u00a0The reason being it is a good place. Is it noisy at times? Yes, but it is a bar/restaurant. That's to be expected at a popular spot.I only mentioned a couple of entr\u00e9es. I have had the salmon as well . . . very tasty. But sitting at the bar I see a lot of food coming from the kitchen, and it all always looks delicious. Also, my kids have had the roast beef sandwich, crab cakes and baked salmon . . all delicious.It does get crowded, so go early.Give McCloskey's a try. You'll be glad you didPS - One dish I did not care for was the fish 'n chips. But, to each their own. Maybe you will like it.", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-16T00:00:00.000", "venue": "McCloskeys Tavern"}
{"review": "Went all the way to the 'burbs because my buddy from work claims McCloskey's has the \"best bacon bleu burger... ever.\" The burger WAS good. There wasn't a bite without bleu and the burger was cooked to perfection. My only complaint was that the bun was lacking. It kinda gave the whole burger a \"i'm not trying but you know i'm good\" kinda look. The burger was also a little too greasy. I would suggest a heartier bun and maybe then it would truly be the \"best burger... ever\". Also the fries were just ok, could have been better. All in all I was satisfied.", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-07T00:00:00.000", "venue": "McCloskeys Tavern"}

If at all you end up here, just try the Crab Cakes (Appetizer)....they are good!Martha....I agree that the service and attitude of servers needs to improve significantly.

Most of the bartenders make good drinks, though had a poorly made one or two. They make great food - burgers, appetizers, fish and chips, chicken sandwiches... all fantastic. Portions are large which makes it great for me and my fiance since we enjoy splitting plates.

{"review": "I had pretty low expectations for this place but it turned out to be quite good! Of course, there weren't many items on the menu that appealed to me but I actually ended up ordering the spaghetti and meatballs, which were quite good! The spaghetti tasted very homemade and fresh, the sauce was very flavorful and a bit sweet, not salty or oily, and the meatballs were cooked well, tender on the inside and very flavorful, except were overly salty. This dish was huge so I actually got two dinners out of it and lots of extra pasta/sauce. Only thing I wish it had come with was a side salad to balance the meal out. I was there on a Saturday night and it was super packed but we were able to get a table for 2 in just a few minutes which was nice and although it was pretty loud, I could hear myself speak and didn't feel like the noise was too overpowering that it prohibited conversation. I would give this 3 1/2 stars.", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-28T00:00:00.000", "venue": "McCloskeys Tavern"}
