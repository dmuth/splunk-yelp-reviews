There's plenty of parking nearby, and it's right on Lancaster Ave in the downtown area.Each of us ordered a dish, and the experience was great overall. The food came out quickly, and all the food tasted good. We had chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, dal, and chicken vindaloo. The vindaloo was delicious and had some nice kick, but unfortunately I did find a few strands of hair in it. Everything tasted great, and they were generous with the rice!Overall a good experience, and I would eat there again.

I ordered one of the lunch specials - Tandoori grilled Paneer (cheese) simmered in a creamy tomato sauce/homestyle lentils flavored with tomatoes, cumin and garlic/diced winter squash stir-fried in a tomato onion sauce - and was pretty satisfied with it, although the red sauce on the Paneer was so RED that it was a little off-putting. Interesting way to serve cheese, to say the least, but the lentils were by far my favorite thing on the plate - very good. I also tried the Onion Bhaji which was really good, the red onion naan bread which wasn't bad, and the spicy mixed pickles - pickle lover that I am I had to try them, but I couldn't tolerate the taste of them at all and they ended up in the trash. Some sort of flavor in there just didn't work for me.We had some issues ordering online - I don't know if our computer system was just slow or what, but we had a heck of time getting our orders in before 10 a.m. (which is apparently what you have to do if you order a lunch special to be picked up). It took us a while to connect so that we could pay for it via PayPal (which we didn't even want to do but it seemed like we HAD to). I had decided to order some extra stuff to bring home to the fam, so I had no problem bringing my total over the $20 minimum. Three coworkers decided to put their orders on one bill, but had trouble ordering online, so I went ahead and put their order through on my account (since I had finally figured it all out). \u00a0Anyway, lo and behold, suddenly there was a pay cash when you get there option so I guess I went through all that PayPal nonsense for nothing. Needless to say, I don't think I've ever been so frustrated ordering anything online in my life.It also seemed to take forever to get our food which we had ordered to be picked up between 12:00-12:15 p.m. Well, we didn't get out of there until 12:45 p.m. so that was a lot of waiting, especially since we had ordered well ahead of time.

{"review": "Tiffin offers one of the best Indian food outlets on the Main Line. Even though it's a chain (regional chain, not national), I still find the quality of ingredients, taste, and overall service to be vastly superior to the one-off Indian restaurants in the area. You must try the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Byriani -- both incredible and absolutely delicious! The service is usually prompt and everything is made fresh, including the bread, which is made on the spot, per order. Prices are a tad high for my taste, but well worth the taste, honestly. The restaurant itself is clean, organized, with decent space. Parking is somewhat difficult (street parking only), but there's little to be done about that.The only reason why I'm not giving Tiffin 5 stars is because it's always a hit or miss on whether they'll deliver the food to my address or not. According to their website, I'm within their delivery radius in Wayne, PA and they have delivered 3 times to me in the past. But 2 of my last 3 orders have resulted in cancellation whereby they call back and tell me they can't fulfill my online order because I'm not within their radius. The online system is based on zip code, so I was left confused as to why my address was excluded. Regardless, a terrific spot and well worth the visit!", "venue": "Tiffin Bryn Mawr", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-04-19T00:00:00.000"}

The water has more flavor.Dessert is where it went completely off the rails. I ordered some concoction they called dessert - an indian take on a creme brulee - and it was unbelievably, nauseatingly bad. After one bite, I told the server as much, and asked if I could get something else, or at least ask to have it redone. She said, and this still sticks with me - I took a bite, so there isn't anything she could do. Then she stood there while I contemplated her answer; service was poor up to this point, but I was struggling to understand how their expectation of payment jived with my expectation of not being revolted. I looked over, and she said \"I had it before and I didn't like it either.\" I was dumbstruck.

They ended up getting us a replacement entree (but by the time it arrived, we'd already basically finished eating). Again, the food here is not bad, it's just that nothing \"wowed\" us.

The way Tiffin serves the entrees is to bring out individual plates for you to pile your rice and sauce on, but it gets really crowded due to the extra bowl for rice (especially if you have a small table).

It was a nice cap to our night.We started with mango lassis, which were more yogurt-y than mango-y, but pretty good all the same. When I asked our server to recommend one of the lamb dishes, he steered me toward the lamb saag; my boyfriend ordered the paneer tikka masala. My lamb was tender and flavorful, and the saag was savory and richly flavored without being overwhelming. His paneer was spongy-chewy and pretty good -- I'm not a big paneer fan, but he liked it. And the tikka masala sauce was delicious. Portions were big; we were hungry and eating a late dinner and we still took home some leftovers.There were two disappointing things, though. One, they didn't ask how spicy we wanted the food; they just made it mild. Both of us would have liked a little more heat. Two, the garlic naan wasn't that great -- the naan itself was very good, but there were little bits of minced garlic sitting on top of the bread. They were a bit too raw (I guess it's better than burned) and the garlic flavor didn't penetrate into the naan at all. There has to be a better way to do garlic naan.Still, the important part is that the entrees were excellent and the service was good.

The pumpkin kofta curry was unlike anything I've ever tried--in a good way, of course. The sauce was rich with pumpkin flavor, and drenched homemade vegetable balls composed of coconut and assorted veggies. Just, wow! I love pumpkin, and was thrilled to see this dish--I must try and concoct it on my own! As for the Navratan Korma, it was similarly delicious, exuding the nutty cashew and almond flavor in every bite. I haven't eaten this dish elsewhere, however, so I don't have any comparison judgements to make. I would have liked for slightly larger portion sizes, but I suppose the quality ingredients and originality of the pumpkin dish made the prices per size of the dishes worth it.
