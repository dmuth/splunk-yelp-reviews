Can true love really be found in the confines of this mortal coil? \u00a0And then...in my mind I hear a still small voice, growing ever louder, eventually becoming like a thunderclap on a hot summer evening. \u00a0The voice tells me to look to the Wawa Sizzli..and it was in the Wawa Sizzli, with sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant...that I find inner harmony, purpose, and meaning. \u00a0Bite after bite comorts my inner being, like putting on that well-worn pair of jeans, sliding tired feet into flannel lined slippers, or the affection of an old and loyal dog. \u00a0And I realize that my identity...my very self...begins to merge with the Sizzli, rendering me powerless to resist its calling. \u00a0I look at the Sizzli, in all its greasy goodness, and ask, \"who is the slave...and who is the master?\"", "venue": "Wawa"}
