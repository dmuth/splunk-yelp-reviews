Our destination was originally PokeOno but we were very happy to stop in at MAIDO and try their Udon instead. I ordered the Kitsune Udon and my partner the Tonkatsu Don. Both were proportionate and tasty. I roamed around their market place and found myself picking up Japanese chocolate, candy and dried squid. This place reminded me of Marukai Market in Downtown LA.

The food in the restaurant part is Japanese comfort food, so you'll find curries, tempuras, and bentos. It's a bit pricier than I'd like, but it really hits the spot if you're in the mood for some Japanese in an authentic setting.The grocery part is fun to explore. Small area, but packed with authentic Japanese goods, including ingredients, snacks, and some packaged food. There are several ingredients in Japanese cooking that you might be hard-pressed to find elsewhere, even in Philly. For instance, there was a mentaiko (spicy cured pollack roe) spaghetti recipe I'd been looking to make, but I could never find a place to purchase mentaiko anywhere in the city - until MAIDO.

Yes it's authentic, but just because you have no competition doesn't mean you can disgrace Japanese cuisine. We arrived 6, didn't get to order until 6:15 because of the 3 whole people ahead of us, and didn't get our food until 6:50. The portions were so TINY I was done eating by 6:59, which is surprising considering how tough and hard to chew their katsu (chicken jerky) was. No joke, I've had katsu probably at 50+ different locations and this one here \u00a0is hands down, no debate, the WORST I've ever had. It's on par with public school lunch cafeteria food.Okinomoyaki was decently flavored, but filling was mostly batter and for $12, there should be more than 2 pieces of meat that are 1 cm big. This was probably the worst tasting meals I've had in the past few years, but I can't get myself to give them 1 star bc they are nice, and the store has some items that are not available in regular grocery stores.", "venue": "MAIDO A Marketplace of Japan", "date": "2018-05-18T00:00:00.000", "stars": 2}

I love the grocery store chock/full of Asian snacks and goods (skincare, frozen dumplings, freshly-made bread and buns, Pocky, jewelry, socks, pens, seaweed, crackers, and more), but I only recently just tried their sit-down restaurant food so that is what this review is for. The service is serious and a bit curt, but I think they just are very matter-of-fact and quick, wanting to do their jobs. I got the large udon with a side of pickled vegetables, a friend got yakisoba, and another ordered katsu don. She didn't like her katsu don but it's only because she doesn't like eggs and there were lots of eggs in it (heads up.) The yakisoba looked good and it was a large portion! I liked my udon but thought the portion of pickled vegetables could've been more given the price, but liked the variety of picked vegetables-I'd never seen 2 of them before! (Yellow, pink, black, and green.) I loved the open kitchen so we could see our meals being cooked, and a Japanese animated film (Miyazaki) played on the wall!

I'd rate three stars for the grocery shop and four stars for the restaurant, and then round it up to four stars for good service and the cute giant teddy bear.This Japanese grocery shop is far from those Asian markets that you can do one-stop grocery shopping. MAIDO is very small and lacks fresh produce (only one small vegetable stand). MAIDO has a great selection of Japanese foods and snacks that you can't easily find in other Asian markets. For the things you can buy elsewhere, MAIDO's price is usually higher.The fast-casual restaurant is the star of MAIDO! Food is freshly prepared in the open kitchen daily and the staff members say they bring leftover home every day. The Japanese salad here is super fresh and the bento box is nicely presented with small portions of different delicious dishes.

My excuse was that I'm a white guy from the PA sticks that, outside of sushi and a little bit of non-instant ramen, really knows nothing about Japanese food. That being said, I'm really happy I tried Maido!, as it offers a diverse selection of delicious food I didn't even know existed.My fiancee and I ordered the Udon (small $6 or large $9 - Japanese thick wheat noodle, dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sake) and the Chicken Teriyaki Don ($12 - Chicken , soy sauce, mirin, sugar, sake, over white or brown rice). I get the sense from both dishes that this is Japanese comfort food, as the Udon, with its rich, yet light, flavorful broth and thick noodles, reminded me of a less salty chicken soup in all the best ways possible (I'm fairly certain it knocked out the cold I had been trying to fend off for a week). I preferred it to the Chicken Teriyaki only a little bit, which was still a great dish, especially that mild teriyaki sauce that is way less salty and sweet than the more Americanized-version you're probably familiar with. Overall, I really enjoyed my time as Maido! and I'm really happy I gave it a try. Other reviewers are free to correct me, but it looked and tasted authentic, and I'm eager to come back to try the rest of the menu.

But it's more like an express Asian market, though for me that is god enough for many situations. They're pretty involved with the Ardmore community, which is very nice that they're putting effort to bring people together. I like that they also have English speakers to help customers out if they are exploring their food options. They also have their own restaurant of sushi, soup, and curry.

But it was the lunch counter that dished out freshly prepared yakisoba noodles, teriyaki dishes, and my all time favorite shrimp okonomiyaki.Moving to Ardmore means that Maido finally has a spot that allows them to have a larger dinning and prep area where they can prepare even more traditional dishes like Katsu Don, udon noodles, curies, and karaage chicken. it also gives them a space to host intriguing events like a Curry cook off and a Mochi-Tsuki Festival.

As someone said there are two H Marts in the area (just under four and nine miles, respectively from Maido), so the selection was expected to be limited to begin with. But I was really surprised at how limited the selection really was. If you're in a bind and didn't have time to run to H Mart, this might be the choice.Next the kitchen/restaurant. It's a one man show with a couple of helpers. The setup is similar to an open kitchen at home, and while the barley tea is self serve and all you can drink, the value ends there. Ten-don is $15, katsu-curry is $14. For that price I expected my pork cutlet to be pink and juicy, not well done and dry. I expected the rice to have high rice kernel definition witha saturated carbohydrate chewiness that Japanese rice are known for, and instead it was a tad too moist and clumped helplessly. The tempura was pretty good, but that's like saying In N Out hamburger was pretty good, it's expected.Finally it took 30 minutes from order to delivery, and while I may have enjoyed watching the chef at work, it was a grueling wait for a hungry man.", "venue": "MAIDO A Marketplace of Japan", "date": "2016-10-30T00:00:00.000", "stars": 2}

The counter seats and the open kitchen are still there, but there's now a fair number of 4-tops to better accommodate groups. You can still order the awesome okonomiyaki and curry, but the menu has also been expanded to include udon noodles and rice bowls (yes, the beef bowls are not a limited weekend menu anymore!). They also added a new bento bar where you can rice (white or brown), 1 or 2 main entrees, and 2 or 3 side dishes. All the dishes were familiar and comforting Japanese bento standards, not to mention that they said the items are not the same day to day! When I went, they had pork katsu, tofu steak, and salmon teriyaki as choices for main entrees -- a good variety of choices to accommodate different diets. The Japanese groceries are back, too! Not much of a dramatic change there, but definitely a worthwhile visit to check out the new eat-in space!", "venue": "MAIDO A Marketplace of Japan", "date": "2015-09-03T00:00:00.000", "stars": 5}

It's worth it if you're in the area but there are better stores like H-Mart in Elkins Park and 69th Street.I notice a lot of people are mentioning Mitsuwa here. While it isn't as big as Mitsuwa. it's hard to make a day trip of that if you only have off on weekends, which is when they're simultaneously packed AND out of stock on a lot of things.

It's been almost a year since they relocated to Ardmore, and I am thrilled that they are back in business again. There really is NOTHING like Maido anywhere else!!They constantly get compared to H-Mart but really that is not a fair comparison, they are completely different (besides the fact that one is Japanese and one is Korean.) So for people who say that H-Mart is cheaper or has a better selection, you are really missing out! Maido is exclusively Japanese and carry things you won't find anywhere else!In addition to being a Japanese grocery store, Maido sells and prepares authentic Japanese food which is delicious and reasonably priced. And it REFRESHINGLY does not have too much sushi options, but instead hard-to-find entrees like okonomiyaki, katsudon, yaki soba, and even bento boxes. I really like that Maido has expanded their restaurant business. Originally, Maido was primarily a grocery store, with a very limited kitchen counter of three food choices. Now they have expanded their menu and added some wonderful new food items. I had the pork katsudon the other day and it was delicious. I am delighted to find a place that prepares some of my favorite Japanese entrees.The only room for improvement that I would like to suggest is that the previous Maido did not carry books and movies for an English speaking audience, and I hope that the new store does. I would love to be able to buy manga or anime in translation.Highly recommended!Pros-excellent food choices, all delicious, affordable, and authentically Japanese-lots of fun grocery items-friendly, hard-working staff-unique and different from any other place in the Tri-State areaCons -parking is tough since it is located in the middle of a busy intersection, try parking in the Suburban Square lot and walking up the street", "venue": "MAIDO A Marketplace of Japan", "date": "2015-09-13T00:00:00.000", "stars": 5}

The portion size is quite big, over 10\" diameter, for $12 would not be a bad price had it tasted good. The batter was boring and mush in the middle. Perhaps I would have said that for most versions of okonomiyaki other than Hiroshima-style, but this stood out because of how thick the pancake was in the middle.The cook was holding my plate for a minute in her hand talking to another customer until the waitstaff realized this and try to take it off her hand, at which point the cook said it's not ready yet and put on the final seaweed topping. Good thing I was not hungry! Although to be fair, the place started filling up after I ordered and dishes were served relatively quickly.The open counter space was clean, with bright lighting. I appreciated the self serve barley tea, although I'm not a fan of styrofoam cups (this seems common to number of places nearby).As for the grocery side, you can get standards like 14oz of tofu for $1.39.
