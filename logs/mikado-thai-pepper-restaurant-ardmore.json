It was fairly creamy, but also had a nice tea flavor.The actual food itself here is very good and I am actually a bit surprised to see all the negative comments regarding the food. I started off with the calamari salad, which was great! The lettuce and vegetable toppings including cucumbers, tomatoes and shredded carrots were all great and the ginger dressing was superb. While the pieces of calamari I got was great, there were only a few and the rest were just small fried pieces. When it comes to sushi, they gave a large variety and they were very good. Tonight, I had the Philadelphia and California rolls. The rice is good and the insides are of very good quality. The salmon and cream cheese were especially great! I also had the chicken teriyaki! It was beautifully played with a flower on top, it was very nice. The teriyaki was also great as the chicken was tender and moist while the teriyaki sauce took it to a whole new level. The side of green brand was also nice. It was so big, I had to bring most of it home!My only concern was that it took a while for our drinks to come. However, once I had my appetizer I felt a bit rushed when the entrees came out very fast.

We've been eating here for over two decades and always enjoyed it, but never again. After a so-so meal with lackluster service on New Year's Eve, our server brought over the bill. My husband placed his credit card inside the billfold and handed it to our server. She came back a few minutes later with the bill and billfold but no card, saying there was no card inside. We told her the card had indeed been inside. She shrugged and laughed. We started searching the floor and told her to please find our card. She offered no apology and seemed to think it was a joke. The rest of the staff had the same attitude, and said we should check our pockets. Even though we knew we didn't have it, we did just that, to prove we'd handed it to the server. The host and manager came over, and rather than express any concern or offer any apology, they accused us of lying and called the police on us! \u00a0Our credit card was never found. Either our server or another staff member pocketed it - the only other possibility is the server dropped it and a customer picked it up, but that customer would have had to be extremely quick. We're absolutely shocked that the restaurant took no responsibility for losing our card, thought it was a big joke, and accused us of trying to skip out on the bill. \u00a0This place used to be wonderful; now it's a nightmare. Avoid at all costs!Update: we reached out to the restaurant's parent company, WIN Signature Restaurants. Their director of development responded to my email by saying she was absolutely appalled by what had happened, and acknowledging the entire situation should have been handled much differently.

The fusion of Thai and Japanese means you get to pick from sushi to pad thai. The interior is tastefully decorated and divided into two sections, with a sushi bar and plenty of seating. Craving the Thai half of the restaurant for lunch, my girlfriend and I ordered the Crispy Calamari appetizer ($8.00), the Pad Thai Shrimp ($9.50) and the Thai Style Sweet & Sour Chicken ($8.50). The calamari was a unique variation, as it was lightly breaded and fried really light, very puffy. It was delicious by the way, and came with two dipping sauces, soy sauce and a creamier sauce. Next up was the old Thai standby, the Pad Thai. Since this dish is served in nearly every Thai restaurant, it's an excellent baseline measurement. The Pad Thai was also excellent - fresh ingredients, well prepared, and large portion size. We ended with the Thai Style Sweet & Sour Chicken. As far as I'm concerned, it was the best dish, the was a perfect blend of the namesake sweet and sour, loaded with veggies and succulent chicken.

Appetizers and dinner were amazing - I've been ordering the massaman chicken curry here for the past three or four times I've eaten here and absolutely love it. I always add extra green veggies. We also ordered a couple of sushi rolls including the Dragon Roll, which was out of this world! Eel, cashew, strawberry!? Try it! We also had their beef appetizer before our meal - it's thin strips of beef, wrapped around scallions - so decadent.Our servers were great, and pulled off the birthday cake candles with grace and style.

They offer a fairly large menu (though I wish they had traditional grilled mackerel) and a choice of seating areas -- tatami area (with chairs, thankfully!), sushi bad and a \"regular\" dining room. We were seated in the regular dining room in which voices really carried (I couldn't avoid hearing the entire conversation of the people next to me), though I would have preferred the tatami room for the charm and relative quiet. The hostess, who seemed inexperienced, did not offer us a choice. We had a friendly, courteous server and delicious fish. The Chilean sea bass on a bed of spinach and mushrooms, as well as the curry salmon with pineapple chunks, grape tomatoes and carrots were cooked to perfection. The unagi/cucumber roll was great for the price and the mango mousse with coconut rice was excellent (except that the rice should have been creamier). They offer white and brown rice, which is nice, and a flavorful green tea. $60 + tip for 2 entrees, 2 green teas, 1 regular sushi roll and 1 dessert.

In this case, I was pissed, and I still am! I have been to Mikado a few times, and every time it was good. Thus, I recommended to my friends that we go grab a quick bite to eat here before we go out. Well, let's just say after that experience I look like a jackass for recommending this place to them. A quick bite turned into an hour and 30 min dining nightmare. First things first, the service was despicable. The waitress waited 15 minutes to greet us, another 30 minutes to take our orders, and then all of our food came out at different times (and when I say at different times I mean 15 minute gap periods). Now, I work at a food establishment so I understand when things are busy the service will obviously be slower, but the place was empty and the employee to customer ratio was 3:1... No excuse for the poor service. The best part was when I asked a waitress to call mine over so I could order, and then the chef peeps his head out of the kitchen and gives my friends and I dirty looks... SASSY! At this point I was worried about the quality of my food so I remained pleasant when the waitress walked over. We order. THEN, after 30 more minutes my friends sushi roll comes out. She said she would wait for us to eat but it was 15 minutes later and no other food had come out, so she ate her roll as my other friends and I sat there with grumbling stomachs. Finally, the rest of the food comes out... It was so average tasting. I figured that I waited 45 minutes for it to be made so it should at least taste decent. I think my school cafeteria food tasted better and that is saying A LOT. Seriously it takes two minutes for the school lunch lady to prepare a decent tasting grilled cheese but Mikado 45 minutes to prepare miso soup, a ratchet chicken lettuce wrap, and fried rice? The fried rice was bland tasting and the chicken in it was dry. Considering the fact that I got an A in cooking class when I was 13 for making some bangin' fried rice, I think Mikado should let me cook everyone some quality fried rice.Anyways, after waiting 20 minutes for the check, we finally leave. (We missed our party). As arrogant as I may have sounded in this review, I will say I have had good experiences at Mikado, and I really like to give people the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0But after tonight I don't think I can ever come back here.

I agreed to switch dishes since I am used to spicy foods and forgot to ask for mine to be spiced up too. \u00a0 Luckily since the flakes were so amateurishly poured on top in one location, I was able to remove a large chunk of the flakes all clumped together into a separate plate. \u00a0Had we not ordered the same thing and switched dishes, she would have burnt her mouth and/or sent hers back. \u00a0 Even after I removed the extraneous flakes, the dish was spicy, but absolutely no flavor. \u00a0I hate spicy for spice sake, but no added flavor. \u00a0I couldn't distinguish between pieces of chicken and pieces of dried up tofu. \u00a0Upon closer inspection, it appears the tofu was REALLY old tofu-chunks they wanted to use up. \u00a0I know they had real tofu since the Agadashi tofu dish did have some real fresh tofu. \u00a0 The sushi/sashimi was delivered and apparently their menu is very LITERAL, we ordered a piece of mackerel and a piece of white-tuna, I thought the pricing for pieces of sushi was relatively cheap, but now realize they literally give you a piece of sashimi for each order. \u00a0I am not going to call foul on being literal, when I should blame most other restaurants for not clarifying between orders and pieces, but this made a bad situation worse in context. \u00a0Just mentioning it here to warn people looking to get their sashimi orders in. \u00a0On our way out the door though, I saw some deluxe rolls and they looked of decent size/quality, so it might not be a fail there. \u00a0When the waitress came by again asking \"if everything was good\", I thought she saw my companion hadn't eaten all that much of her dish and that I had put all the tofu pieces ripped open to show the cottage cheese consistency they had devolved into. \u00a0My response to her was \"Not really\" getting ready to explain how both dishes were a disaster to which she promptly (with a big smile) said \"Thank You\" and walked off. \u00a0 As we suspected early on, the language comprehension skill was just not there and our opportunity to have the matter addressed was seemingly done. \u00a0We were in a rush, so the opportunity to flag down a manager who could actually understand us and perhaps remediate the situation wasn't there. \u00a0My friend left 85% of her plate there and didn't want it wrapped up, which should have also been a clue, but we just asked for our check and left swearing it was likely the last time we were going there for awhile.", "stars": 1, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}

I know what fresh uni tastes like, and it takes a bad batch of uni to completely ruin a whole meal, something that I didn't mind risking.Our tempura and crab nuggets came out first, and I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0The crab nuggets looked like it was made in-house, and the tempura batter was just right. \u00a0 The oil it was fried in was fresh and \u00a0didn't taste like old frying oil which was a plus. \u00a0The tempura was also drained properly so it felt light to the palate. \u00a0The vegetables in the tempura were just al dente, and were still alive with flavor. \u00a0The oil was at the perfect temperature since the broccoli didn't retain any. \u00a0Awesome.Next came the marble roll which had at least 3 kinds of fish and a funky wrapper. \u00a0The fish was pretty good, firm and placed together right. \u00a0The other roll called the sunset, left a bit more to be desired. \u00a0The plum paste was a bit salty and the shiso leaf reminded me of grape leaves. \u00a0That combo didn't bother me as much as the salmon eggs that topped the slivers of fish on the roll however. \u00a0The eggs were old and desiccated. \u00a0Yep, they weren't as fresh as they should have been. \u00a0I WILL add however, that unless you picked up one of these eggs and ate them separately, that it would be hard to tell- \u00a0the shiso leaf, plum paste and wasabi mask it up pretty well. \u00a0But yes, the pic shows the desiccated state; they should be plump, shiny and firm.The uni- \u00a0I shouldn't have ordered it. \u00a0At 4 bucks a sushi, I was expecting better, much better. \u00a0I was very disappointed with my decision to even try it; I usually gauge a sushi joint with the freshness of their uni. \u00a0Unless the uni can be guaranteed that it indeed came in that day, stay away and save the money for another round of drinks instead.Over all, the service was great, hence the 3 stars, but the sushi needs help. \u00a0We will be going back again to try the Thai side of things, we hope that our next experience with the cuisine is a better one. \u00a0Well at least it's gonna be all cooked next time around- \u00a0till then!", "stars": 3, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}

So let's break it down:The service: 5/5Every time I have come to Mikado Thai pepper, my table is always ready. I did show up once without a reservation and thought the wait was going to be at least 15-20 mins, but apparently they have an additional dining room upstairs which was great. All the waiters and waitresses are very helpful and actually know the menu. What I mean about that is when I am looking to order at some restaurants, some of the staff cannot tell me how a dish may be prepared. Atmosphere: 4/5The restaurant does get a little noisy on a Saturday night, but that is to be expected. Their are a number of large tvs which I thought was a bit tacky however I did come on a Sunday night during playoffs and was great. Their was a lot of Thai decorations which did make it seem more authentic and Japanese style tables was a nice twist.The food: 5/5So the sushi I found to always be great, the best on the main line without a doubt. The fish is always fresh, the presentation varies on what types of sushi you order. So I was a big fan of their specialty rolls, I love mikado roll and super dragon roll. I normally order a rainbow roll everywhere (I think it's a fair balance and variety). For the other dishes, I have had the soft shell crab tempura which I thought was a very generous helping. Honestly I was enough to feed 2-3 people. Pad Thai I thought was very well done. The yakitori bowl is a great bang for your buck. My new favorite is the spicy noodle with chicken.

{"date": "2012-07-07T00:00:00.000", "review": "Mikado Thai Pepper is easily one of my favorite restaurants located along the Mainline in Ardmore. As soon as you enter, you realize the words present on the restaurant's web page, \"experience the enchantment. . .\" Of course, if a place has delicious food, that typically is all that matters for me, but ambiance is a plus. As you notice by its name, Mikado Thai Pepper presents two types of cuisine, both Japanese and Thai. That being said, the restaurant has a dual theme; you can choose to either sit in regular upright chairs, or a Japanese-style setting that brings one closer to pristine, wooden floors, reminiscent of a tea house.In the few times that I've had food here, there were no complaints, aside from one instance of slower than usual service. But the food was delicious. I try to stay true to the restaurant's theme, and choose both Japanese and Thai items. Shrimp shumai, one of my favorite small dishes, is done very well. The shrimp is fresh, and the dumpling sheet is not overly chewy. Dipped in the sauce it's served with, I'm always tempted to order a second plate. Many of the entr\u00e9es served here are also worthwhile. True to tradition, the food is colorful, flavorful, and a lot healthier than other alternatives. The Thai Style Green Curry (also offered in red) with tofu (or chicken) is a tasty dish. More recently, I had the Thai Basil Fried Rice with crab. It packs a zesty punch, served with a variety of leafy greens and firm vegetables. If you have room for dessert, have no fear, there are some excellent options. Have you ever had fried ice cream? Think ice cream and your favorite tempura roll, but just the breading; it's something like that. If you're not interested in a fried dessert, try mochi ice cream. You have the option of a few flavors of ice cream, wrapped in a chewy, rice dough (mochi).As a Thai enthusiast, I highly recommend Mikado Thai Pepper, especially if you're looking to explore the realms of Asian cuisine.", "stars": 4, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}

Please note I am a vegetarian so this review is solely based on the veg foods offered, of which there are plenty. \u00a0When I go to Mikado my stomach is beyond empty and my wallet is full. \u00a0The menu is packed with my favorite foods. \u00a0Vegetarian items are clearly marked, a big plus in my book. \u00a0Here is an example of gluttony, i.e. the order my husband and I placed last night for the two of us:Vegetable Tempura AppetizerCrispy Tofu with a Plum Peanut SauceWasabi Mashed Potatoes2 beers of his liking that I really can't remember1 Vegetable Roll1 cucumber/avocado/cream cheese rollRed Tofu Curry Fried Ice CreamMoji Needless to say you could have rolled us out of there. \u00a0Everything was absolutely amazing. \u00a0The red tofu curry is seriously one of the best things that I have ever put into my mouth; so good I may have to amend the last meal of my Yelp profile. \u00a0It comes with three generous rectangles of fried tofu, artichokes, green beans and an assortment of peppers placed upon a red curry sauce, or what will be known to me from here on out as the sauce of the gods. \u00a0My mouth is watering like a Pavlovian dog. \u00a0 The appetizers and rolls are also amazing. \u00a0It's really hard to mess up vegetarian sushi though so maybe don't take my word for it but I've visited with fish eaters and they've never complained. \u00a0The tempura is crisp and varied, the tofu was yummy and the plum peanut sauce gave my taste buds a lovely massage. \u00a0The wasabi mashed potatoes are glorious. \u00a0If you add some of the red curry sauce or some soy sauce they are absolutely perfect. \u00a0I wish I had some right now. My only complaint is the dessert and really it's not so much a complaint as I have no business ordering dessert after a huge meal and I know it. \u00a0I've had several desserts here and have never been totally satisfied with any of them. \u00a0If you're going to order dessert stick with something traditional like the green tea ice cream or the moji. \u00a0Last night's fried ice cream came out smothered in honey so I had to send it back. \u00a0Maybe I was being a jerk but I am a firm believer that honey should not come anywhere near my ice cream, or really anywhere near any of my food for that matter. \u00a0Anyway they were nice enough to bring me some honey-free fried ice cream, but it was just okay. \u00a0 I'm keeping my rating at five stars despite the desserts and the television and the slow service of last night. \u00a0That's how strong my love is for the food at Mikado/Thai Pepper. \u00a0Mmmmmmm.", "stars": 5, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}

So my adventurous, sushi-loving friend and I stopped by for a dinner.As we walked in, I immediately loved the authentic feel this restaurant had. From the sunken floors to tradition wooden doors, I liked everything except how the restaurant was small and I felt somewhat cramped. We didn't have a reservation, but we got seated very promptly at a table.As for the food, however, I felt very indifferent about it. I ordered the salmon, tuna, red snapper, and some other rolls. It wasn't horrible, but either was it excellent. Something in-between - perhaps mediocre - would describe my experience. I didn't notice that the fish were extra fresh or tasty. Maybe that's why each dish was fairly cheap. Since the price range was on the lower side, we ordered a lot and ate until we couldn't breathe.Overall, Mikado was just okay - but definitely nothing to write home about. Still, Mikado is undoubtedly the best option for those of you who live out in the suburb. If you are craving sushi, but don't feel like driving out to Downtown, then consider Mikado as one option.", "stars": 2, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}

Meal choices were basic and kind of blah- not that many exotic choices of rolls and cooked \"meals\" felt strange- my teriyaki was simply protein with sauce on it and a side of green beans. I could have made that at home. Oh wait, they added a flower on the plate. Wow. It also came with a side of white sticky rice. Thanks so much. I'm quiet underwhelmed.My friend had a California roll- there aren't many other choices really and a mixed tempura plate.

The service upstairs is fine, but because the servers are going up and down the stairs a lot, it's not quite as quick as downstairs. Still, it's not been a real problem on our visits.The sushi here is quite good. Along with Ginza in Narberth, it's our top choice for sushi in this area of the Main Line. We think it beats Sushi Land, Samurai and Fuji Mountain in nearby Bryn Mawr, but everyone has their own sushi preferences. Specialty rolls are tasty, fresh and generously sized and there's a good selection. Volcano roll could use a little less sauce, but is still excellent. Dragon and Godzilla rolls are other good choices, and the shumai and gyoza hit the spot. The fried oysters appetizer not so much.

That's a travesty!Okay, so maybe I'm biased -- a friend of the family took me out for my first taste of sushi at Mikado YEARS ago, and I've been a sushi addict ever since. I've been to the majority of the sushi restaurants on the Main Line, and I even visited my cousin in Okinawa Japan and had sushi daily for a month, so I feel pretty confident in saying that Mikado is one of the best I've had in our area.I've never had a bad meal here -- all the special rolls are tasty (and the dragon roll on fire [think that was the name] was just plain amusing), the tempura is great, the sukiyaki is delicious, and the lunch menu is reasonably priced. As a bonus, Mikado is now owned by the same people as the Thai Pepper, so they've added some interesting Thai dishes to the menu as well as the VERY addictive Thai Iced Tea.Also, as an interesting side note, the person who took me to Mikado for the first time had a Japanese exchange student living with her. This girl had gone to every single Japanese restaurant in the area, looking for one that served rice with the right amount of stickiness, and she said that Mikado cooked it perfectly.The wait staff is always very friendly and very prompt. I've had slow service maybe once, and that was on a night where they were severely understaffed, so it was unusual. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the decor is neat with the depressed \"pseudo-traditional tables\", a gimmick I've never seen in any other Japanese restaurant.I've been to the restaurants around here enough that I tend to go to one over another if I'm in the mood for a certain dish (for instance, Samurai has the best chirashi I've ever had), but as I've never had a bad meal at Mikado, I often choose them over the others.", "stars": 5, "venue": "Mikado Thai Pepper Restaurant"}
