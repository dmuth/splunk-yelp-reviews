{"review": "Their Media location originally hooked me to Iron Hill but this location always kept me coming back. Even when I've hard horrible experiences at other locations, this one reminds me why I love Iron Hill and why I will always be a loyal customer to this brand. The moment you walk through the door you are greetes graciously by everyone: the hostess, the manager and any other staff who may be around. They all are happy and ready to assist you.I'll say every bartender is not groomed the same. Some have excellent pour game, some need some work in that department. None the less I had a wonderful experience. I sat at the bar with a friend and discussed work and the usual life happenings. The manager checked on us several times when there was no bartender in sight which was helpful because we were already being taken care of but the fact that he kept checking means they really value customer service.As always the food is amazing. The Santa fe turkey burger is my favorite as is the Voodoo Chicken Pizza.See you next week for another happy hour", "stars": 5, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2019-03-10T00:00:00.000"}

It's an atypical restaurant with its own beer, and you can tell they probably put more effort into the beer and a bar atmosphere than the restaurant part considering service in the seated dining room area was kind of slow. The menu itself boasts every time one of their beers is used or best paired with.We went straight to entrees, and I got the fish and chips while my mom got the falafel burger. While my food was stellar (with the exception of the weird paper that just fell apart underneath the food...cute attempt at the newspaper thing but kind of failed), my mom's burger was lackluster at best.

{"review": "This last time was less than stellar. First we came in and decided to wait a little while because of wanting to sit in a specific area in the back of the restaurant. We were told by the host that there was another area of the restaurant where patrons could seat themselves, but we really didn't mind waiting for the area we wanted to sit in. After a little while longer waiting, we were told again by an employee there was an area for patrons to seat themselves. While I get it, they were trying to get us seated, we had no problem waiting. Overall, to me, it just seemed like unnecessary pressure to sit in that area. We just went, and I admit, I was a little reluctant. When we got to this bar area/dining room, we sat down at a table with no table setting and had to wait a while before any waitress even noticed us. Once she did give us the menus, her attention to us was sporadic. In that particular room, she seemed to be assigned to multiple tables and it was difficult to get a hold of her at all. At one point my husband did a beer tasting to decided on a beverage, and the waitress again just disappeared, leaving all the tasting glasses on the table for an extended time. Our appetizer plates sat on the table for most of our dinner untouched, and we received maybe one refill of water after a considerably long disappearance from our waitress once again.My grilled chicken sandwich arrived with no kind of sauce on it, even though aioli is advertised as the spread. On the bright-side, after I complained to the waitress about this, they did comp our dessert.

I highly recommend doing the flight, \u00a0it's a great deal and they have a large variety of beers on tap for you to choose from. Calamari - the breading was okay and the flavors were kind of bland. \u00a0Not amazing.Chilled noodles - this was the best thing for $3.95. The small plate is a good size and it satisfied my craving for Asian noodles with lots of good flavors. Solid choiceFlight of beer - great! We loved this.Service - it was good, but not great. We were looking for our waiter for awhile at one point. Also, there was and ton of seating In the dining room so I'm not sure why they couldn't seat us immediately?", "stars": 3, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-03-09T00:00:00.000"}
{"review": "WOW! This place is huge! Somewhat of a quiet night compared to what I always imagined. We purchase at neighboring establishments quite often and this place just always seem really crowded from the outside. Then again it was a bit late!Our options were limited to the late night menu so we only had a few items to choose from. The appetizers seemed rather \"appetizing\" but apparently would not make good for combos (if you're thinking of pairing different items from that section). Our waiter was kind enough to point that out.We eventually decided to go with the calamari and nachos which were packed with cheese, beans, halepineos and sour cream. I've had better nachos but it was tastey and good for sharing. The \u00a0drinks were way better than I expected. I had the pomegranate margarita and hubby had the raspberry lemonade. Call me weird but I honestly thought the glasses were the cleanest I'd ever come across in a restaurant. They were crystal clear!After reading other reviews, I definitely will be going back to try other items on the menu.

If I remember correctly, they also serve a flight of beers if you want to try mutiple at a time.I am one to try something new each time, but I almost always get their brick oven Voo Doo chicken pizza. It's sweet, savory, and has a little kick to it! As a family we tend to order their hummus app and chipotle buffalo wings! Yum! I've also had their pulled pork, fish and chips, and chicken salad sandwich. All pretty fantastic! It can get busy at times but the servers are still attentive and nice.

{"review": "A belated review given the solid event I've hosted inside of it, and the different times and settings that I've been able to check out within. But in an area that's a such a huge beer haven now thanks to Tired Hands (especially with my being less than 3 blocks from Fermentaria), its been easy to lose track of Iron Hill as another solid option, with it being no fault to them whatsoever. Because with the eclectic food offerings, solid beer menu, and ability to offer other alcoholic beverages to the non beer drinkers; IH is a standout brewery that delivers with a unique level of character despite them holding down so many locations.The first visit was just to savor some beers and try some appetizers among friends. And with a Celtic red, one of their solid Belgian ales, and a an exceptionally hoppy IPA I got to experience the widespread and frequently updated variety of brews that they typically have to offer. Meanwhile the chicken wings were reasonably price and yielded a decent spicy kick without the overkill. Being the former cheese monger that I am I was instantly drawn to the odd sounding fried goat cheese, and while it was as weird and random as I expected, it was also kind of decent.On my second visit I got to host a vast table of friends and Iron Hill accommodated us admirably. It also gave me a chance to trying a n amazing dish from their veggie menu, and savor even more brews like their impressive Jumanji. Add in a 3rd visit that delivered some Hawaiian inspired brews and their incredibly priced \u00a0meal deal, and between all three I had enough different experiences to leave me sold!", "stars": 4, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-09-03T00:00:00.000"}

For dessert, we got the triple chocolate hill, which is a large brownie and ice cream type dessert and that was also great. I guess my review would be better if I could comment on the beer, since this is a brewery, but even if I tried it I wouldn't even know what's good, haha. But, it is definitely above average gastro pub food. However, the price tag reflects that. We didn't even do entrees and still spent around $60.

{"review": "With a spacious restaurant and wide selection of good beer, Iron Hill will please everyone. So of course I'm going to compare Iron Hill Brewery with local microbrewery favorite Tired Hands next door. Tired Hands is a beer lovers brewery, with a menu that reads like a wine tasting list. However, if you're not into all that stuff and just want a wide variety of great beers with a diverse menu, Iron Hill Brewery will more than satisfy. The beers at Iron Hill are your more traditional selections such as \u00a0IPAs, Hefeweizens, Lagers, and Ales. The ones I sampled were superb, such as the Witberry, the House Lager, and my favorite the Hefeweizen. This is but a small sample of the beers they have on tap, and I plan on coming back many more times to check out the entire beer menu.I was also able to sample the food at Iron Hill, starting with the nachos. The nachos comes in two sizes which are both pretty large, so if you only have a few people I'd recommend the smaller option. They were excellent by the way - good amount of chip-to-cheese-to-salsa. I also ordered the House Smoked Pork Sandwich ($12.95). The pulled pork I thought was a little so-so, lacking the hickory smoke flavor I was promised from the menu. The coleslaw was a bit watery as well. It was the only disappointing part of the entire meal.Overall, I really enjoyed Iron Hill (especially the beer), and I plan on coming back many more times.", "stars": 4, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-07-05T00:00:00.000"}

{"review": "I believe I checked out Iron Hill years ago, at the Media location. I was just entering the world of craft beers and tried one of their IPAs. I hated it. Not really the fault of Iron Hill, it's more that I learned here that I just don't like hoppy, pale ale/ipas. This may partly explain why it's taken me this long to give the place a second shot, but I also don't go out too often and when I do lately it's been primarily to Philly Proper. I can now say I'm glad to be back, because we had a fantastic experience there at McThrill's Pregame. There was a light crowd at happy hour and I was one of the first to show so I took a seat at the bar. Knowing now what kind of beers I like (and don't), I went straight for their Pig Iron Porter. I actually don't care what other beers they have or will ever have, so long as they keep this gem. I was planning on having 1 before the event, which promised booze, but I ended up having 3 because it was so good.I sampled some of their happy hour snacks; chips and Guac and the amazing roasted Brussel sprouts. I've been on a Sprout kick recently and these were better than expected. Our small group grew larger and we moved from bar to table, (McThrill did make a reservation for 15). The staff handled our ever growing party fantastically. I know it wasn't easy when we all had to shoot over to Pinot's and needed separate checks quickly. To backtrack, most of us are meals there because the event was food free. I saw some amazing choices but none deterred me from thinking I made the right choice with their bacon bleu burger. It was an above average burger that really hit the spot after a few porters. Again, an overall great experience and an added bonus that it took place almost exactly where Kiddie City had their video game (all 2600 titles!) section in my early years of riding my bike out here.

The hardest thing about Iron Hill isn't the parking. It's remembering what I ate there for dinner. Their grub follows a pattern of bland that is truly lackluster and devoid of inspiration or flavor, but hey. At least it's consistent.  The cheesesteak egg rolls, though? Surprisingly, they're amazing, and perhaps the sole outlier within an expansive menu of mediocrity that takes the form of a novella (not Cheesecake Factory-level redonkulous, but you get the gist). Something for everyone, but almost nothing for me.Every time I go, which is probably once a year, if that, I ask myself why I'm here, and why it's so popular. I first went to one in Phoenixville and was underwhelmed. Then I lunched at their Chestnut Hill spot, and I felt the same.

{"review": "Not impressed. This place has been on my to-do list for quite awhile so maybe I built it up too much in my head and had high expectations...but there are some key factors leading to my rating that can't be ignored.Number one issue - the service was weak for a slow Sunday evening. I look around us and there are servers checking their phones, chit-chatting, the place is pretty much looking overstaffed. But somehow it took 15 minutes to even have our drink orders taken. And then at the end of the meal it took even longer to receive our check. Number two issue - the value for the price. I have no problem paying $10 for a well-crafted small plate. But we ordered the Voodoo Shrimp for $9.95 and received 5 measly little teeny tiny shrimp swimming in some spicy sauce and a little scoop of rice to the side. If the shrimp were large, that would be one thing, but these were laughable. We also had calimari (nothing special) and a grilled salmon salad (equally unexciting - although a nice portion size for that).

{"review": "I can't say enough good things about Iron Hill in Ardmore! The entire staff is very friendly and helpful, the beer list offers something for everyone and the food is phenominal! I have yet to have a bad meal here.Flights are a great way to sample a few beers and narrow down your beer selection, if the detailed descriptions don't do it. And once you find a favorite it's best to go back often because they're always changing out the selection. Most recently I had their anniversary brew \"Ferrous 20\" and it surprisingly became my new favorite beer (surprising because it has a very bright yellow hue to it, which I assumed equated to not liking it). I had to bring a growler of it home it was so good.A new offering on the appetizer menu was Fried goat cheese, served with onion confit and strawberry compote. This is a great dish, and the flavors work so well together! I do suggest asking your server for a side of crostini or \"bruschetta bread\" to smear all that tasty goodness on. The crunch of the bread helps breakup the richness of the cheese and really sets the dish off!They also have this awesome to-go offer where you can get 2 pizzas and a growler of your choice for $25. You can't beat this deal! The pizzas are smaller, so probably best for 2-3 people, but a perfect answer to a cozy date night in, with a few pieces left over.The bar area is really nice with numerous TVs around and high-top tables and booths for groups of all sizes. I've always sat in the bar are because I really like the vibe, but the dining room behind the bar looks really nice, quiet and a great place for families or a date night out. The parking isn't the best, with a small strip lot directly in front of the building, and a larger lot across the street, but both fill up quickly and on a Friday or Saturday definitely expect to take a few laps around before finding a space.

My second experience was more of a dinner situation in which everyone had burgers. My Santa Fe burger (which comes with beef or turkey) could have been excellent. The brioche bun was delicious, the guacamole fresh, and the bacon crispy to boot. Sadly, the meat paddy was so incredibly thick that the beef completely overtook the other flavors.

However, the manager was able to \"find\" our reservation and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated.For apps we had the cheesesteak eggrolls which had a good crisp exterior and what you'd expect inside, and the fried Brussels sprouts which were delicious .The seafood bisque was a hit.Of the entrees, \u00a0I most enjoyed the Jaegerschnitzel ( a \"brewhouse favorite\") which consisted of two tender breaded and fried pork chops with a rich mushroom sauce, served with buttered noodles and green beans. Very tasty, my only criticism it was a little on greasy side so not for \u00a0light eater!There is, of course, also a variety of house brewed beers on tap and available for take home in growlers. So that's a plus if you enjoy craft beer, or just want to give it a try. \u00a0Ambiance is casual, bustling and a bit on the noisy side for conversation. Service was quick though as this place is new it was not surprising that our server seemed a bit inexperienced.Overall, we had a good experience here and would return.", "stars": 3, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-02-24T00:00:00.000"}

{"review": "We were fairly excited as this restaurant is a favorite of a close couple.We were greeted in a timely manner and the front hostess was friendly. We were seated very quickly on a Friday night which was nice as many places have hour long wait times even at 9pm on a Friday. We we were asked drink orders from a waitress promptly. We placed orders for peach tea and water with lemon. No more than a few moments later different waitress came up and asked us the same thing. It seemed that there was not much communication between people at this point. The original waitress came back probably about 5 minutes later with our drinks and states she would be back with lemons (which she never did return). I took a drink of my \"peach tea\" which tasted like a weak regular ice tea with no sweetness at all. BUT MUCH to my disgust there was a fly in my drink. Which did cause us to be a little turned off already. The second waitress came by to take our order and we mentioned the fly and that it was not peach tea but she seemed to kind of pass it off with a Ohh, hmm (as she looked in the glass at the fly) and mentioned that the other waitress said it was peach tea. She never really apologized for this but asked if she wanted something else to drink. We ended up doing a couple taste test and ordered the beer sampler as well. The free taste test were of decent size and were appreciated. The beer sampler was nice because it was not the cost of a full glass and it gave us a chance to see what we would want for a glass with dinner. The waitress was well versed in the beer varieties and suggested appropriate flavors after asking our likes. The cheesesteak egg rolls were delicious, we would have wished there were just one more on the plate as an appetizer. We both ended up getting burgers which were good, just not amazing. We decided to try a dessert- the apple crisp. Which ended up begin far from crisp at all it. It was warm but not enough to actually start to melt the ice cream like we are used to. the portion size was generous and was perfect for sharing. Overall we would be willing to come back another time and hope for a better experience. However i was very disappointed that there was not a real apology from the waitress but mostly not from a manager. I would expect a manager to apology for the fly in the drink to ensure that we would not let this first experience deter us from returning again.", "stars": 2, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2016-12-16T00:00:00.000"}

The presentation was lacking and reminiscent of diner food. \u00a0Overall, it was okay but definitely won't be on my go-to list of restaurants.", "stars": 3, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-02-08T00:00:00.000"}

Good texture and very tasty. \u00a0My daughter had a fish taco and a penne pasta dish, both of which she enjoyed. \u00a0That Sunday, a free beer and salad came with my daughter's entree - but not the burger. \u00a0All in all a pleasant evening. \u00a0It's nice to have another place in Ardmore.", "stars": 4, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-01-21T00:00:00.000"}

{"review": "I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. We went Fathers Day. It wasn't that busy. For appetizer we had the guacamole, it was bland. We had quesadilla chicken and fish and chip and my son had fish and chips. He got fruit a as side. The fruit came in mott's fruit cup ( hardly fresh). My son ate one bite of fish, it was black. My quesadilla was discusting. I'm not even sure it was chicken, it was a tan color. The waitress (wendy) never once came to ask how was everything. I had to ask for ketchup from another waiter. When wendy finally came to the table she ask how was everything. I said \" the food was really awful\". She laughted and walked on.

{"review": "Second time at Iron Hill last evening around 7PM. In simple words...what a sh** show. The bar area was too crowded, not able to reserve a table in the bar area, more of a first come first serve. I felt like we were hunting for our prey, but it was just a table to hold our group of 10. There needs to be a better system in place. Once our group was able to get a long high top, trying to get a server's attention was our next big task - took way too long to get more drinks, asked for water and that took more than 10 minutes, and the overall service was not up to par. Needless to say, our meet up group won't be back on a Saturday evening to this establishment unless major improvements are made in the overall service.

{"review": "I want to like this place. We've always enjoyed going to the one in Media. \u00a0The food here is good but some things are overpriced. Something like 12 bucks for three cheesesteak eggrolls. \u00a0As someone else said, stick to the things they do best and you will be fine. The burgers, for example, are flavorful, moist, and juicy. There are certain things they do well.We're been here a few times now and most of the time and most of the time the service has been adequate, at best. \u00a0Tonight our service was dismal. The waitress seemed completely clueless. She never removed the huge menus from our table throughout the entire meal. \u00a0She also never cleared our app plates. Finally another server came and took them away. \u00a0When my husband's drink was low and he requested a refill, she brought him one but did not refill mine, which was completely empty. \u00a0Through my entire meal I had nothing to drink. \u00a0When our entrees came, I had to send mine back. \u00a0I had requested no mushrooms, yet there they were on my burger. \u00a0My companion sat there with his food and I had nothing, after being informed that it would be several minutes before they could cook me a new burger. \u00a0Meanwhile, our waitress came back to the table and asked, \"How is everything tasting?\" \u00a0I was sitting there with no plate. Did I look like I was \"tasting\" anything? \u00a0Eventually she said she had had \"a brain fart\" putting the order into the system. Yes, those were her actual words! \u00a0Finally, the staff that deliver the food always \"auction\" it and never seem to know who is supposed to get what. \u00a0When our waitress finally returned and I asked for a drink, she looked at my glass and appeared shocked. Towards the end of the meal we finally asked another server to remove the menus from our table, which he quickly did. \u00a0You would think by now enough of the staff were aware of the fiasco that was happening at our table, and a manager would have come by. Nope. \u00a0No one apologized, thanked us for visiting, or even noticed us eventually exiting the restaurant. \u00a0These folks need to go back to restaurant training school. \u00a0Rant finished!", "stars": 2, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-06-05T00:00:00.000"}
{"review": "The food here is great and this is definitely one of the nicer Ironhill's that I've visited. The food is awesome. I have not had one meal that I've disliked yet. The soup sampler is great, wings are great, pizza is good, sandwiches are on par and Ive also enjoyed the salads. Oh and I can't forget to mention the desserts! If you can save room I highly recommend the triple chocolate hill. On the other hand the beer isn't super impressive in my opinion. I've definitely had good beers here, but I live in Ardmore so I blame the other great brewery in town for spoiling my tastebuds. Ironhill is still a great spot if you're lucky enough to get a seat.

I love their brie stuffed mushrooms and the baby back ribs were delectable and so tender! The sweet potato fries are also fabulous. Our service was excellent, but to top it off, I had called two daysahead to make a special request for dessert as we were celebrating a birthday. Their banana bread pudding is absolutely delicious, and a favorite of the birthday girl, so I asked them to put eight pieces together and serve it like a cake. Well, it came beautifully served (candles supplied by us) with their excellent ice cream scoops all around the edge. I truly appreciated the staff going above and beyond for us and we will definitely dine there again! I don't drink, but this restaurant is just fine for the non-drinker.

{"review": "Iron Hill Brewery is a nice addition to Ardmore. We had dinner in the back restaurant section. The food was good and our server was very (maybe even too) friendly. I do think the wait staff needs some additional training. Our drinks were served to us with the server's hands all over the glasses -- a good way to spread germs. Also, although we liked her very much, she was overly chatty. I had an opposite experience when I was there for lunch recently, seated in the bar area: once our food was served, we didn't see the server (or any other staff) again at all until well after we had finished eating. We weren't asked about beverage refills until or anything else until she finally returned. At dinner, part of the chicken breast in my entree was completely undercooked, but they did take it off the check and ask if I wanted something else. To sum up, I basically like the restaurant but do think they need to upgrade their staff's professionalism.", "stars": 3, "venue": "Iron Hill Brewery  Restaurant", "date": "2015-01-28T00:00:00.000"}
