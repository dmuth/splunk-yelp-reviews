{"venue": "John Henrys Pub", "stars": 1, "review": "Went to John Henry's on a whim last night after seeing it in passing on the way to Nudys or McCloskeys. It was definitely quiet on a Monday night, which I later found out was wing night from 5-9 (half priced wings), so that was exciting. My boyfriend and I ordered the wings to start which were delicious. He ordered a Guinness to drink and I ordered a Diet Coke- unfortunately it was extremely flat and tasted like an off brand soda so that was disappointing. I liked the feel of the place overall, had a friendly neighborhood vibe that was very comfortable. For dinner I ordered the south philly pork sandwich. It was served on a long roll that was very fresh. The sandwich had a good amount of meat and had some hot peppers. Came with delicious steak fries. The problem arose when I got home. I took half of my sandwich home with me and went to eat it tonight but saw a dead fly in it. I am disappointed because I enjoyed the food but I can't get around a dead fly.", "date": "2018-08-14T00:00:00.000"}

Dr. Steak thoroughly enjoyed a center cut pork chop stuffed with apples and nuts with a peach glaze. \u00a0I stopped him from gnawing on the bone that remained. \u00a0Two hearty carnivorous thumbs up. \u00a0He is grieving the loss of the hot open faced turkey and roast beef sandwiches, though, as he felt they were the best in the region. \u00a0I, likewise, am grieving the downsizing (though not price wise) of their legendary house salad bowl, now a 'plate' of house salad with exactly 3 chunks of bleu cheese dancing around. \u00a0Also gone are the curly fries, an item they did well.Service was fine, our server though really did not have any skill at 'selling' \u00a0a dish to a diner. \u00a0She was reasonably responsive though, so 'adequate' would be the rating here.The new menu overall seems to have some good additions to explore. \u00a0I just wish they hadn't messed so much with what was working for us in the process. \u00a0Change.

{"venue": "John Henrys Pub", "stars": 3, "review": "The first two times I visited John Henry's I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Not because of the food or the drinks but as a result of the service we received from the bartender. I am drawn to JHP because it's walking distance from my house, the outside patio and the fact that they serve Carlsberg year round. The first two times I went with my roommate we were ignored by the bartender for long periods of time and then when he did return he was not polite. The bar was not crowded at the time so I didn't quite understand his frustration or lack of attentiveness. I chalked it up to a bad day the first time and then after we came by a second it two bad days too many. I even asked the bartender if he was having a bad day and he ignored me and mumbled something under his breath. My roommate refuses to come here now.Last week I went to JHP to grab a Carlsberg and to watch the World Cup semi final. And to my surprise I was greeted by Mary who welcomed my order and topped up my drink every time it got low. She even talked to me about the game and different options on the menu. This was beyond great service. I ordered food and stayed a little long then I had planned to. JHP would be so much better if Mary worked the bar all the time. I am a year out of college and don't expect bartenders to be \u00a0superb everywhere I go. But I also do not expect them to be out right rude. I haven't lost faith is JHP potential to be a great local bar but I will probably only come back when Mary is tending bar.Oh yeah the food was good, standard pub food but served very hot and fresh.", "date": "2014-07-16T00:00:00.000"}

Waffle fries, they were so yummy especially paired with chicken fingers and their OLD honey mustard. Along with cheesesteaks it was one of the things I craved most when going home.

{"venue": "John Henrys Pub", "stars": 5, "review": "I've lived in Ardmore for about 4 1/2 years now and have been frequenting JHP since then. I think people get the wrong idea about it sometimes. This isn't a bar where you are going to be blown away by outstanding food or classy beers and that is exactly what i appreciate about it. What you will find if you become a regular, is that every time your walk in, you'll run into a friend or acquaintance. John Henry's is the local Cheers of Ardmore. I've seen staff come and go over the years and they have all for the most part, been great people. Jimmy and Kathy the owners are some of the nicest people I know and JP is not only a friend, but probably the best bartender in Ardmore along with Kevin over at Yeats. Like I said, the food is never going to blow you away, but it is exactly what you can expect from your local hangout. There are a lot of good options right off the bat on the appetizer menu, ranging from awesome nachos with chicken to mussels in marinara. If you're a wing lover, JHP has the best wings on the Main Line. These aren't dinky wings, they are nice and fat and you always get a good portion of them, not to mention the wide variety of sauces you can choose from. The somewhat recent addition of the fry menu is also a really nice touch. You can order anything from waffle fries to curly fries. Favorites are definitely the gravy fries (Disco Fries) and bacon ranch fries. Other options include Irish nachos and pizza fries. You also won't find a better cheesesteak in Ardmore and on Sunday, they are only five buck with fries included. At places like Bella Italia, where they over cook EVERYTHING, your going to be disappointed. The JHP cheesesteak is the perfect mix of cheese and juicy beef. Their chicken cheesesteaks are just as good. The one black spot on the menu is the French Onion Soup which seems to be one of the biggest complaints among Yelp users. It is always way overcooked and occasionally tastes like metal. To be honest, despite how much I love it, I don't really see it being a necessary menu item at John Henry's. If you are ever in Huntington, NY, check out Canterbury Ales. They have the best French Onion Soup I have ever had. The beer selection is what you would expect from any sports bar with the nice added touch of a couple of rotating taps. I'm on the bar's dart team and usually just order cheap stuff like Miller Lite during matches or Sunday Football, but if I'm going for the night, they have options like Blue Moon, Guinness, Harp, Flying Fish, etc. I was actually pleasantly surprised to find out the other night that they added the Dogfish Head Punkin ale on tap which is quite possibly my favorite seasonal beer. JHP isn't just a bar to go grab a beer and a steak, they also have some great events like Quizzo Thursdays with Steve. While I don't go to that to much anymore, it's usually a lot of fun. John Henry's also does an annual road trip to a Phils game every year which always ends up being a blast. They even had their first annual Oktoberfest this year working along side McClosky's and Gillanes and seemed to be not only very fun, but extremely successful. JHP also has the NFL Sunday ticket, so if you're an NFL lover, you can go there and pretty much guarantee that you'll be able to catch your game. John Henry's remains and probably always will be my go to bar and favorite place in Ardmore. From the frequent regulars to the awesome ownership, if you know what you're going there for, you'll never leave disappointed.", "date": "2011-09-27T00:00:00.000"}

Reminded me a little of a bowling alley.Service: Less than perfect.I can't pin it all on the server, she was a sweetheart, I think she was alone and overextended. She couldn't see the high tops from the dining room and the bartender didn't back her up at all. He could have at least ran menus or water out to waiting customers, especially when there's no one at the bar.Food: I've had better.- Quesadillas: Large, greasy and heavy on the jalapeno. Cheesy & meh.- French Onion Soup: A waste. It was as if it had been cooking for days and all the flavor had been cooked out of it.- Spinach Artichoke Dip: \u00a0In light of our other options, we gobbled this up. The chips were good, from a freshly-opened bag. - Burger: Ordered well, served medium. Anti-climactic. One of the more impotent burgers I've had in a long time. Just bland, no life to it and cooked wrong. I rarely put ketchup on my burgers, I think a good burger should be able to stand on its own without it. I put ketchup on this one. I didn't even enjoy the fries the burger came with and I've rarely met a fry I didn't like. They had a generally poor flavor and consistency. How does a place with a whole page of its menu devoted to fries serve bad french fries? Riddle me that, Batman.It didn't really strike me as a sports bar, nor did I see any evidence whatsoever of Irish Pub thrown in. It seemed to me more like a mediocre restaurant with a bar you might find in some rural, small town. As the locals' watering hole, I'm sure it's fine.

It's a little tucked away being a short walk down Cricket Ave from Lancaster. They're open for lunch through the evening and things don't get too crazy until after 10 pm. The dining room off the side of the bar serves families and a portion of the restaurant/bar can be reserved for parties. I went to one once and it was a lot of fun :)They have a daily $5 sandwich special which comes with fries, most of which are better than average. Their happy hour runs early from 4-6, but it's daily and you get buy-one-get-one Free appetizers and cheap domestic beers (last I checked it was $2.50 dom drafts and bottles). They've started rotating a couple taps for seasonal and imported beers (glee), but I usually stick with the Yuengling. Best of all, the cooler temps are nice and cold so your bottled beer is well chilled and your draft beer is served in a chilled, frosted mug. Favorite menu items are the cheese steaks, chicken wings (and I'm from the Buffalo area), artichoke flatbread pizza, quesedillas, chicken sandwiches, the house salad with candied walnuts, and the french onion soup (yes, it comes with mozz, but it's still delicious). People I know that love hamburgers think that they are the best they've had in Ardmore. They have several large screen TV's for watching sports and a decent size back patio. If you show up during a Phillies, Steelers, or Eagles game, then bring your game face because the place can get packed. I know they have had music on occasions, but I've never been.

All in all I love it here when I just want to come and relax, the back patio is a cool place you can sit at as well. The bartender's are friendly, and I dig the Corona Buckets on Friday's! Four for $10, not too bad. One of the few bars in the area that actually stay open UNTIL 2!

Well not completely. As my friends got unusually impatient because of their thirst, the waitress finally came over about 15 minutes after our arrival and asked if we wanted anything to drink. \u00a0So...my friends ordered the Heineken special (as mentioned on the board) and I ordered the usual \"girly\" drink...a Lemon Drop Martini (yummy). \u00a0 10 minutes later she returned with the 3 drinks...and mentioned that the Heineken \"special\" didn't start until 10:00pm. \u00a0It was now 8:00pm. \u00a0She then proceeded to walk away. \u00a0She didn't ask if that was okay or if they wanted something else since the special didn't start until 10:00. \u00a0But my Lemon Drop was delivered without any problems...yay!Anywhoo...the food wasn't half bad. \u00a0My friends ordered the Flat Iron Steak special (they are all about the specials) and I had the Caesar Salad Bowl (a salad that could easily feed a family of 4). \u00a0Just as quickly as the food was delivered, it was devoured by all three of us. \u00a0It was then onto dessert...2 sundaes and 1 caramel brownie surprise. \u00a0By the end of that course we were entirely stuffed and ready to take a nap. \u00a0Overall, the food was not too bad and the atmosphere was very cozy with 6 TVs in the main dining room for patrons to watch. \u00a0John Henry's is definitely affordable. The final bill for the 3 of us including drinks and tip was $60.00. \u00a0And there is a private meter-free lot in the back of the restaurant to park.", "date": "2008-04-08T00:00:00.000"}
