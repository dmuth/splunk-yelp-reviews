Being from New Jersey and being used to grade A pizza, I was disappointed by the lack of good pizza in the West Philly, Manayunk, Ardmore area. I decided to explore different local pizzeria's to find a good spot to satisfy my need for good quality pizza. After trying Bella Italia for the first time, I was in love! The pizza is great! The crust is thin, sauce is delicious, perfect amount of cheese. I have tried a few things on their menu other than just the plain slice. I have had a white slice here which is delicious and difficult to pull off; Bella Italia did it perfectly! I have also tried the meatball parmesan hero, the french fries and mozzarella sticks. All were delicious and I would have again! The only downside of this spot is that the pizza is a bit oily but the napkin trick will fix this issue! Other than that Bella Italia is the perfect spot to get a pie to go from, grab a slice, grab a sandwich ect! The staff is very friendly; owned by a sweet husband and wife straight from Sicily! Which is probably why their pizza is so good! If you are in Ardmore and want good quality pizza; try Bella Italia!"}

By the time I got there a few minutes later, my order was already by the cash register. The woman I spoke to on the phone was much more friendly in person. She began speaking to me very excitedly in Italian, probably noting my tan skin and curly hair. I had to let her know I am not Italian, but actually half Puerto Rican, which seemed to make her equally excited and we began chatting in Spanish instead. She ended up calling her whole family over and they jabbered in Italian about how pretty I am. I walked out the door laughing, with warm smiles and waves.My cheesesteak was very large for the cheap price. The chicken was a little dry but the sandwich was flavored very well. I was excited to see they sell Jarritos (delicious brand of Mexican soda), as well as averagely priced six-packs.Not the most amazing meal I've ever had but it was such a cozy and heartwarming experience that I'll happily give this family my business again.

I must say this was the best pizza I have tasted in quite some time. The sauce was the star here, very good flavor which added to the cheese and the delicious crust. $3 bucks per slice of plain, but I wont bitch about price because it was worth it in my honest opinion.As far as the owners.... what you read in the reviews is correct! So if you are looking for good \u00a0conversation you will not get that here. Kind of felt like a Soup Nazi vibe when I walked in....I had there attention right away and I got the feeling they do not like for people to take there time with the menu or ask alot of questions with the order. This did not bother me because most times I am not looking for annoying, superficial conversation anyway, just good food.The restaurant appeared clean and had a variety of pizza for take-out along with a good beer selection.My next trip I plan on trying out the cheesesteak and fries but so far I can attest to the fact that you cant go wrong with the pizza thats for sure.I plan on returning very soon.

Times have changed and looks like the quality has changed from what I had remembered. I don't get it why change something that was selling, where others couldn't match up. I was in here a few times recently and I haven't seen the big guy making pies, or his wife greeting you when you come in. Prices before have changed, and now they are asking for an astronomical amount for a slice. Maybe I haven't gotten a slice in a while, but $3.50 for a slice of sausage, or mushroom ? Really , I mean really that is a little absurd , and to think this isn't a gourmet slice, it is one of the usual suspects' \u00a0when it comes to the toppings in the world of pizza. Another item that they topped in was their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich, this was one of my \"go to orders\" when I would come here religiously. This , or something has altered my one time \"go to sandwich\". Now I hate to say it its just burnt sauce with \u00a0a freezer burned chicken finger. Throughout their existence they have remodeled a bit, opening it up a little more to seat the people. They also have improved their menu to go with the times, but again the quality has diminished . The only thing saving this from becoming a 2 star review is they serve beer while you eat."}

{"date": "2008-03-25T00:00:00.000", "stars": 4, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "I can't even remember how old I was when I started going to Bella Italia...It may have been high school but I don't want to date myself because I think they have been in business for close to 20 years.Bella Italia has everything: pizza, calzones, Sicilian pie, strombolis, sandwiches, salads, burgers, pasta dishes, ziti, lasagna, ravioli,manicotti, hoagies...even Italian ice for dessert. \u00a0...all at very reasonable prices. \u00a0The decor is a little old but the food definitely makes up antiquated ambiance. It is open relatively late hours during the week and on the weekends. \u00a0They also have domestic and imported beer for purchase."}
{"date": "2012-01-13T00:00:00.000", "stars": 4, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "Found this place only recently. This is my new favorite pizza in the area. They make their own dough each day and you can tell. Great crispy crust - not soggy. The owners are always there and are great. I haven't tried the rest of their menu so I can't comment there. Plus, you can get a six pack to go - which is nice."}
{"date": "2012-09-15T00:00:00.000", "stars": 1, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "Admittedly, I have not had their food, but their takeout beer section sucks. WAY overpriced, and the price goes up and up the less you buy (e.g. 1 bottle of Yuengling costs as much as half a sixer). Not only that, the 6 packs here cost nearly twice what they cost at the Ardmore Beer Shoppe (which has a way better selection, I might add), and 2/3 the price of a CASE of a comparable spirit at Ardmore Park Beverage. They ripped me off a few times back when I was first in the area. Some folks told me that Bella Italia was where you go to buy beer, but it turns out that this is not at all true.I wouldn't try their food, either, since they would probably gouge me on that front, too. I would expect to leave without my shirt."}

{"date": "2009-09-17T00:00:00.000", "stars": 4, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "Bella Italia is one of those places that you grow to love more every time you go. \u00a0The pizza was above average the first time I had it, but after going back a few more times it became even more enjoyable. \u00a0There is definitely character to the place.If you're looking to go to a restaurant that's nice, this is not the place to go. \u00a0As soon as you walk in they're selling six packs and 40's... not a real classy look. \u00a0And then if you have to go to the bathroom you have to pay a quarter... not a really classy feel to it.As for the pizza... I feel that the dough's the best part. \u00a0They also don't add too much cheese on their pizzas, which makes it a lot less greasy then your typical pizza joint.(good thing in my opinion) \u00a0Pizza's very consistent.Great choice if you just wanna grab a quick meal or a decent six pack.I'm a fan"}

I've lived in Ardmore for two years and have tried other pizza in the area. None come close to Bella Italia. The owner works every day and is a nice man. The pizza is no gimmick with a lot of flavor. If you go and eat-in you can usually catch a soccer game on TV. They also have a half decent take out selection of beer too."}
{"date": "2012-06-19T00:00:00.000", "stars": 2, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "I live in the area and regularly and semi frequently eaten here for the last almost 20yrs, \u00a0but sadly BI has been on a slow downhill slide over the last couple of years.Really surprising since the place is still owned/run by the same family. WAS a place to get great NY style slices, and maybe still is sometimes, but lately it seems that pies look old like they have been sitting out for way to long, and sort of taste that way too.My kid and I stopped in there last night and I had a cheese-steak hoagie, or should I say a cheese-gristle hoagie, since I constantly had to pick same out of my mouth, bleech..had to throw the other half away. \u00a0To top it off ,tab for my hoagie, my kids 3 slices (2 saugage, 1 cheestake slice -granted more expensive that one) and 2 sodas: 24.00! \u00a0Something is not right. My wife told me she stopped by last week for a slice and a drink, 6.50?? I think someone needs their calculator fixed..."}

They also exhibit a tell-tale sign of a good pizza joint with their back TV permanently tuned-in to Premiership/Serie A games. \u00a0Tempted to try their cheesesteak one of these days if I can ever get past the pizza..."}

Been going there since the 1970's and for New York style,thin crisp crust pizza, this is where you go. The owners are very nice. Don't go for ambiance or atmosphere, go for the Pizza. Cheese steaks and french fries pretty good too!"}
{"date": "2012-10-29T00:00:00.000", "stars": 5, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "I absolutely love Bella Italia's Pizza. It's boardwalk style which is very hard to find in the suburbs. Chewy and just perfect for that style. \u00a0The large pie is huge and in my experience always cooked perfectly. \u00a0I love the Italian owner and the staff too. Buona Pizza! People complain about the beer and prices, take out 6 packs are always expensive especially in PA. Take some time trying to separate alcohol from the State if you want to see some fair pricing competition."}

{"date": "2009-07-30T00:00:00.000", "stars": 2, "venue": "Bella Italia", "review": "meh! why all the fuss about this place. Perhaps nostalgia for people that have been going for years or because for lack of a better place in the immediate area? I wasn't impressed. It was just okay and honestly I felt a bit stingy. Also a bit over priced for what the quality and the portion sizes of most items. The buffalo wings just plain sucked! Over cooked, chewy and a meager squirt of sauce over the top of those chewy little buggers. I asked for blue cheese and clearly the woman helping me would have preferred not to have given it over. I think she would have liked to have charged me for the supposed \"additional\" sauce and the blue cheese dressing, which I think is standard for wings (note the sign at the register stating the .75 for these things and the dressing is from a can anyway). Nice! gotta buy a forty if you want a beer. Can you say up sell! Take a drive and get your moneys worth unless for the sake of convenience in the area you could be okay with the pizza, but might feel a bit ripped off with all the great choices not to far away!"}
